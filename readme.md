**Hello.** Looking for the Saltarelle source code repositories?

They've all been moved to a dedicated [Saltarelle](https://github.com/saltarelle) GitHub account.

Did you know that Saltarelle was recently [acquired](http://bridge.net/bridge-acquires-saltarelle/) by Bridge.NET, and the two code bases will be merged and released as Bridge.NET 2.0. [More info.](http://bridge.net/bridge-acquires-saltarelle/)
